# 🤖 AI Concepts: Semantic Search, RAG, and More

A comprehensive guide to understanding key AI concepts used in modern applications.

## 🔍 1. Semantic Search

### What it is:
Semantic search finds documents that are **similar in meaning**, not just in keywords.

### 💡 Example:
> **Query:** *"How do I create a pod in Kubernetes?"*
> 
> **Matched Doc:** *"Steps to launch a container using kubectl"*
> 
> Even if the doc doesn't contain the exact words "create pod", the meaning is similar.

### ⚙️ How it works:
1. **Text → Embedding vector** (e.g., via `get_embedding`)
2. **Search input vector** is compared to stored vectors (using cosine similarity)
3. **Closest vectors** are returned as relevant matches

### 📝 Use Cases:
- ✅ Knowledge base lookup
- ✅ Search in help docs or chat history
- ✅ AI-powered search engines

## 🧠 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### What it is:
A method where the AI **retrieves relevant context** before generating an answer.

> **Formula:** `Retrieval + LLM Generation = Better, accurate results`

### 🔄 Workflow:
1. **User asks a question**
2. **App searches internal docs** using embeddings (semantic search)
3. **App injects top relevant docs** as context into the prompt
4. **LLM generates answer** based on that injected context

### 🎯 Why it matters:
- ✅ Gives LLM access to external knowledge
- ✅ Reduces hallucination
- ✅ Keeps answers factual and grounded

### 📝 Use Cases:
- 💼 Chatbot over your company docs
- ⚖️ Legal/financial assistants
- 🏢 Enterprise search assistants

## 📄 3. Document Similarity

### What it is:
Measures how **similar two pieces of text** are (e.g., two support tickets, two FAQs).

### ⚙️ How it works:
1. **Get embeddings** of both documents
2. **Use cosine similarity** to compute how close they are
3. **Return similarity score** (0-1 range)

### 📝 Use Cases:
- 🔄 **Deduplication** (finding repeated content)
- ❓ **Matching user questions** with FAQs
- 📊 **Grouping similar documents** in clusters

---

## 🧠 4. Memory / Context Injection

### What it is:
Injecting **prior knowledge or memory** into the model's prompt to guide its behavior.

### 🔧 Types:

#### **Long-term memory**
Past interactions or facts stored externally (e.g., vector DB)

#### **Short-term memory**
Injecting relevant recent dialogue directly into the prompt

### 💡 Example:
> If the user earlier said *"My name is Sam,"* you could inject `User name = Sam` into the system prompt.

### ⚙️ How it works:
1. **Retrieve relevant info** (from chat logs, notes, embeddings, etc.)
2. **Inject it into the system/user prompt** before calling the model
3. **Model responds** with context-aware answers

### 📝 Use Cases:
- 💬 **Conversational agents** that remember facts
- 🎯 **Task-specific agents** (e.g., finance agent knows your goals)
- 👤 **Personalized assistants**

## ✅ Quick Reference Table

| **Term** | **Purpose** | **Based On** | **Use Case** |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 🔍 **Semantic Search** | Find text with similar meaning | Embeddings + similarity | AI-powered search |
| 🧠 **RAG** | Inject retrieved content to improve LLM answers | Embeddings + prompt injection | Chatbot over docs |
| 📄 **Document Similarity** | Compare two texts for meaning closeness | Embeddings + cosine similarity | Deduplication, matching |
| 🧠 **Memory/Context Injection** | Provide LLM with relevant background info | Prompt design + retrieval | Personalized AI agents |

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

- **Embeddings are fundamental** to all these techniques
- **Cosine similarity** is the most common way to compare embeddings
- **RAG combines search + generation** for better answers
- **Context injection** makes AI more personalized and aware
- **All techniques work together** in modern AI applications
